Notes for the DNN Phase of the ECE 755 Project
DNN Phase aka Milestone 1

So core of the DNN is made of:
    4 Inputs: 5 Bit Signed
        4 Neuron Input Layer
            4 Hidden Neurons
                ReLU Unit
    2 Outputs: 17 Bit Signed

The other secondary status inputs & outputs for the module
    Input Ready : Can use to power gate elements down the pipeline. 
    Output Ready: Each output has it's own ready signal (Not very useful right now.)

Each Neuron is made of: MAC Unit
    Split MAC Design (Implicit Pipeline)
    Multiply inputs in first cycle --> Buffer to Pipeline
        Read from Pipeline --> Accumulate

So first let's make the split MAC.
    5 bit Operands --> 10 bit multiply results --> 12 bit neuron output (adding four 10 bit numbers)
    Use the input ready signal as a power gate. 

Implemented a 17 bit Neuron for the Output Layer. 
Note:
    Some confusion here, regarding whether the outputs of the ReLU 
    are supposed to be added in the final layer or not.
    Version 0 of the neuron adds the ReLU outputs.
    All weight vectors are assumed static.
